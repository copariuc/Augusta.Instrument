  abstract = {Emotion regulation has been dichotomized into two related but distinct domains, namely cognitive and behavioral. There has been an emphasis on the development of measures that evaluate these emotion regulation domains separately. Recently the Behavioral Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (BERQ) was developed. The present study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of a Persian version of the BERQ (BERQ-PV) among an Iranian sample. We investigated the dimensionality, reliability, and validity of the BERQ-PV among participants from the general population (n\,= 556) and clinical patients (n\,= 92). The confirmatory factor analysis supported the five-factor model. The internal consistency (Cronbach's {$\alpha$}\,=\,.59--.78) and test-retest reliability (r\,=\,.63--.82) of the subscales were acceptable. The significant correlations between the BERQ-PV subscales and depression, anxiety, and stress supported concurrent validity, and the correlations with measures of cognitive emotion regulation implied convergent validity. The significant disparity among the clinical and non-clinical sample groups on the BERQ-PV was suggestive of discriminant validity. Findings indicate that the BERQ-PV is a psychometrically sound measure for assessing the behavioral process of emotion regulation.},

  abstract = {Despite growing interest in the role of regulatory processes in clinical disorders, it is not clear whether certain cognitive emotion regulation strategies play a more central role in psychopathology than others. Similarly, little is known about whether these strategies have effects transdiagnostically. We examined the relationship between four cognitive emotion regulation strategies (rumination, thought suppression, reappraisal, and problem-solving) and symptoms of three psychopathologies (depression, anxiety, and eating disorders) in an undergraduate sample (N=252). Maladaptive strategies (rumination, suppression), compared to adaptive strategies (reappraisal, problem-solving), were more strongly associated with psychopathology and loaded more highly on a latent factor of cognitive emotion regulation. In addition, this latent factor of cognitive emotion regulation was significantly associated with symptoms of all three disorders. Overall, these results suggest that the use of maladaptive strategies might play a more central role in psychopathology than the non-use of adaptive strategies and provide support of a transdiagnostic view of cognitive emotion regulation.},

We combined 241 effect sizes from 114 studies that examined the relationships between dispositional emotion regulation and psychopathology. We focused on dispositional emotion regulation in order to assess patterns of responding to emotion over time. First, we examined the relationship between each regulatory strategy and psychopathology across the four disorders. We found a large effect size for rumination, medium to large for avoidance, problem solving, and suppression, and small to medium for reappraisal and acceptance. These results are surprising, given the prominence of reappraisal and acceptance in treatment models, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and acceptance-based treatments, respectively. Second, we examined the relationship between each regulatory strategy and each of the four psychopathology groups. We found that internalizing disorders were more consistently associated with regulatory strategies than externalizing disorders. Lastly, many of our analyses showed that whether the sample came from a clinical or normative population significantly moderated the relationships. This finding underscores the importance of adopting a multi-sample approach to the study of psychopathology.},

AIM: The present study aimed at validating the factor structure and psychometric properties of the Hindi version of the BERQ (BERQ-H) in a sample of Indian population. METHOD: A community sample of n\,=\,358 individuals completed the Hindi version of the Behavioural Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7, and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-10). RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis revealed that the original five factor structure of the BERQ was replicable. Confirmatory factor analysis favoured a modified five factor structure of the BERQ-H. The unidimensional and the second order factor models of the BERQ-H were not supported. The internal consistency reliability of the BERQ-H subscales was acceptable. Withdrawal, Actively approaching and Ignoring subscales showed inverse associations with depression, anxiety and psychological distress. Seeking distraction did not correlate significantly, whereas Seeking social support showed atypical associations with depression and psychological distress. CONCLUSION: The BERQ-H is a reliable and valid measure of behavioural emotion regulation strategies. It is advisable to mainly interpret subscale scores on the BERQ-H instead of the overall score.},

Confirmatory factor analyses supported 9-strategy structure, with an improved fit 27-item version (CERQ-S-27). Generally adequate composite reliability (CR between 0.63 and 0.84) and temporal stability (ICC between 0.38 and 0.71; p\,{$<$}\,0.001) were found. Subscales correlated coherently with measures of depression, well-being and resilience, and T-tests indicated different use between older adults who did or did not have depressive symptoms. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that subscales predicted depressive symptoms (R2 = 0.17; p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and psychological well-being after six months (R2 = 0.21; p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Results provided evidences of concurrent, predictive and criterion validity, suggesting that the CERQ-S-27 could be useful for studying use of cognitive emotion regulation strategies among older adults and understanding their influence in ageing and mental health.},

Method: The Spanish version of CERQ (CERQ-S) and other scales (gratitude, emotional intelligence, satisfaction with life, depression, anxiety and stress) were completed by 835 adolescents aged 14-18 (455 girls) from the South of Spain. Results: The results showed that the CERQ-S in adolescents (CERQ-SA) has appropriate psychometric properties with indexes of reliability a = .89 and w = .96, and the original nine-factor structure was confirmed. There was also significant correlation between the CERQ-SA and the other scales, showing evidence of convergent validity. Conclusions: The results suggest that the CERQ-SA could be useful for appraising cognitive coping in adolescents. This will help to expand the study and understanding of these strategies, their influence and their consequences for adolescents' psychological functioning and health},

We report a quantitative meta-analysis of 212 studies (N = 80,850 participants) that measured the associations between coping and emotion regulation with symptoms of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Within the meta-analysis we address the association of broad domains of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., total coping, emotion regulation), intermediate factors of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., primary control coping, secondary control coping), and specific coping and emotion regulation strategies (e.g., emotional expression, cognitive reappraisal) with internalizing and externalizing symptoms. For cross-sectional studies, which made up the majority of studies included, we examine 3 potential moderators: age, measure quality, and single versus multiple informants. Finally, we separately consider findings from longitudinal studies as these provide stronger tests of the effects. After accounting for publication bias, findings indicate that the broad domain of emotion regulation and adaptive coping and the factors of primary control coping and secondary control coping are related to lower levels of symptoms of psychopathology. Further, the domain of maladaptive coping, the factor of disengagement coping, and the strategies of emotional suppression, avoidance, and denial are related to higher levels of symptoms of psychopathology. Finally, we offer a critique of the current state of the field and outline an agenda for future research.},

In a general population sample of 251 males and 379 females, data were obtained on symptoms of depression and the use of nine cognitive emotion regulation strategies. Significant differences were found in the strategies Rumination, Catastrophizing and Positive refocusing: women reported to use these strategies more often than men. However, no differences were found in the extent to which specific cognitive strategies were related to the reporting of depressive symptomatology. In both groups, higher extents of reporting self-blame, rumination and/or catastrophizing as strategies were strongly related to higher depression scores, whereas higher extents of using positive reappraisal were related to lower depression scores.},

This review takes an evolutionary perspective and characterizes emotion in terms of response tendencies. Emotion regulation is defined and distinguished from coping, mood regulation, defense, and affect regulation. In the increasingly specialized discipline of psychology, the field of emotion regulation cuts across traditional boundaries and provides common ground. According to a process model of emotion regulation, emotion may be regulated at five points in the emotion generative process: (a) selection of the situation, (b) modification of the situation, (c) deployment of attention, (d) change of cognitions, and (e) modulation of responses. The field of emotion regulation promises new insights into age-old questions about how people manage their emotions.},

There is a brief, 18-item version that measures the same nine strategies as the full version (Garnefski and Kraaij, 2006a). The aim of this study was to develop a brief form of the CERQ, taking into account two different proposals: a 27-item and an 18-item instrument, the latter focusing solely on the assessment of the two general factors obtained in the second-order structure of the original CERQ model and identified in previous studies as adaptive strategies and less adaptive strategies. Participants in the study were 872 individuals aged 18-58 (mean 33.86, SD=8.43). The confirmatory factor analyses yield adequate overall indices in both versions, together with satisfactory validity. In the discussion, it is argued that the 27-item version is more appropriate for the specific rating of the nine regulation strategies people employ, and we propose the 18-item version as a suitable instrument in clinical context for an overall rating of an individual's cognitive emotion regulation profile, furthermore, the criterion validity with depression and anxiety keeps similar to the larger versions.},

The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the 2-index presentation strategy is required to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true-population and misspecified models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the ML-based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true-population models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when sample size is small.}

Consequently, examining individual differences in the habitual use of emotion-regulation strategies has considerable potential to inform models of this debilitating disorder. The aim of the current study was to identify cognitive processes that may be associated with the use of emotion-regulation strategies and to elucidate their relation to depression. Depression has been found to be associated with difficulties in cognitive control and, more specifically, with difficulties inhibiting the processing of negative material. We used a negative affective priming task to assess the relations among inhibition and individual differences in the habitual use of rumination, reappraisal, and expressive suppression in clinically depressed, formerly depressed, and never-depressed participants. We found that depressed participants exhibited the predicted lack of inhibition when processing negative material. Moreover, within the group of depressed participants, reduced inhibition of negative material was associated with greater rumination. Across the entire sample, reduced inhibition of negative material was related to less use of reappraisal and more use of expressive suppression. Finally, within the formerly depressed group, less use of reappraisal, more use of rumination, and greater expressive suppression were related to higher levels of depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that individual differences in the use of emotion-regulation strategies play an important role in depression, and that deficits in cognitive control are related to the use of maladaptive emotion-regulation strategies in this disorder.},

  abstract = {Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is an affective disorder with sustained negative affect and difficulties experiencing positive affect as its hallmark features. Previous work also highlights cognitive biases and deficits in cognitive control that accompany depression and suggestions have been made as to how cognitive and affective aspects of the disorder are linked. Recent work proposes that difficulties in the self-regulation of affect after experiencing negative life events may contribute to risk for the onset of depression, and indeed there is evidence that depressed patients exhibit more frequent use of maladaptive strategies when regulating affect and show difficulties effectively implementing adaptive strategies. Cognitive aspects of depression may play an important role in helping us understand these difficulties in self-regulation. This article reviews recent work on emotion regulation in depression and links cognitive biases and deficits associated with depression to difficulties in the self-regulation of emotion. Importantly, a main goal of the article is to identify topics in need of future attention that could greatly help shed light on the relation between cognition and emotion regulation in this and other psychological disorders.},

Our objective was to analyze the use of coping strategies in the general population with attention to sociodemographic variables, and to test the capacity of these strategies for mediating in repercussions on mental health. The 1,160 adults who participated in this study answered the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ-S) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). The data were collected in a CAWI (Computer Aided Web Interviewing). The results suggest that the coping strategies they used the most differed depending on sociodemographic characteristics, such as age, sex and education. Furthermore, two mediation models were estimated for positive and negative coping strategies in the relationship between the presence of COVID-19 near them and mental health. The ``negative'' coping strategies were found to exert an indirect effect as mediators in the impact that COVID-19 positive cases near them had on their health. The consequences to mental health of the impact of coping with adverse situations should not be underestimated and it is important to design programs to educate the population in coping strategies that promote their health.}

In a sample of 457 adults from the general population the psychometric properties of the BERQ (measuring dispositional coping) and its relationship with well-being and the CERQ were examined. Principal component analyses supported the allocation of items to the subscales, with alphas of all scales being high. All BERQ scales correlated significantly with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Higher use of Seeking Distraction, Actively Approaching and Seeking Social Support was related to fewer depression and anxiety symptoms, suggesting these are more adaptive strategies. Higher use of Withdrawal and Ignoring was related to more depression and anxiety symptoms, suggesting these are less adaptive strategies. The BERQ and CERQ scales were mainly small to moderately correlated with each other.

In comparison to the BDI and BAI, the DASS scales showed greater separation in factor loadings. The DASS Anxiety scale correlated 0.81 with the BAI, and the DASS Depression scale correlated 0.74 with the BDI. Factor analyses suggested that the BDI differs from the DASS Depression scale primarily in that the BDI includes items such as weight loss, insomnia, somatic preoccupation and irritability, which fail to discriminate between depression and other affective states. The factor structure of the combined BDI and BAI items was virtually identical to that reported by Beck for a sample of diagnosed depressed and anxious patients, supporting the view that these clinical states are more severe expressions of the same states that may be discerned in normals. Implications of the results for the conceptualisation of depression, anxiety and tension/stress are considered, and the utility of the DASS scales in discriminating between these constructs is discussed.},

A sample of 654 children aged 7--12 years completed the CERQ-Sk and tests for depression and anxiety measures. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the 18-item version and the original nine-factor structure, which includes self-blame, acceptance, rumination, positive refocusing, refocus on planning, positive reappraisal, putting into perspective, catastrophizing, and other-blame (comparative fit index = .99, Tucker--Lewis index = .98, root mean square error of approximation = .02). Internal consistency was adequate (ordinal {$\alpha$} = .80), and the eight-week stability of this version was moderate (intraclass correlation = .69). Criterion validity was supported by correlations among self-blame, rumination, and catastrophizing (positive) and among positive reappraisal and depression and anxiety symptoms (negative). Results suggest that the short version of the CERQ-Sk is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing these cognitive emotion regulation strategies during the middle childhood developmental period. Clinicians and researchers will benefit from this briefer acceptable version when time is not available for the 36-item version.

  abstract = {Use of cognitive emotion regulation strategies in response to stressful life events varies by country, though research has been limited to comparisons between American and Asian cultures. This study aimed to compare six European countries to investigate cross-cultural differences in the use of cognitive strategies and test if the relationship between specific strategies and psychopathology varies across countries. Data arrays were collected from the Netherlands, Hungary, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Germany (N=1553) and cross-cultural measures of cognitive emotion regulation using the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) were included. Measures of depression and anxiety were also included. Results showed significant differences on all the subscales of the CERQ. Most notably, there were differences on strategies that have been linked to symptoms of psychopathology; overall northern European countries (Germany and Netherlands) made less use of strategies such as rumination, catastrophizing, and other-blame, when compared to southern and eastern European countries (Spain, Italy, Portugal, and Hungary). The direction of the relationships between specific strategies and symptoms of psychopathology was consistent across countries. Although there were cross-cultural differences in the use of cognitive strategies, the consistent relationship between strategies and psychopathology across countries supports the idea of a trans-cultural approach to treat psychopathology.},

  abstract = {Cronbach's alpha is a statistic commonly quoted by authors to demonstrate that tests and scales that have been constructed or adopted for research projects are fit for purpose. Cronbach's alpha is regularly adopted in studies in science education: it was referred to in 69 different papers published in 4 leading science education journals in a single year (2015)---usually as a measure of reliability. This article explores how this statistic is used in reporting science education research and what it represents. Authors often cite alpha values with little commentary to explain why they feel this statistic is relevant and seldom interpret the result for readers beyond citing an arbitrary threshold for an acceptable value. Those authors who do offer readers qualitative descriptors interpreting alpha values adopt a diverse and seemingly arbitrary terminology. More seriously, illustrative examples from the science education literature demonstrate that alpha may be acceptable even when there are recognised problems with the scales concerned. Alpha is also sometimes inappropriately used to claim an instrument is unidimensional. It is argued that a high value of alpha offers limited evidence of the reliability of a research instrument, and that indeed a very high value may actually be undesirable when developing a test of scientific knowledge or understanding. Guidance is offered to authors reporting, and readers evaluating, studies that present Cronbach's alpha statistic as evidence of instrument quality.},

  abstract = {Research on the development of emotions and their functional characteristics as regulators of behavior has grown dramatically over the past 10 years. There is currently renewed emphasis on the importance of emotion regulation and dysregulation for our understanding of normal development and the development of psychopathology. The 11 essays that constitute this Monograph survey theoretical, conceptual, and methodological issues involved in the study of emotion regulation, placing particular emphasis on the role that physiological systems play in the regulation of emotion and on the interface of a biological and a behavioral perspective. The Monograph is divided into three parts. Part 1 contains essays on the definitional issues involved in the study of emotion regulation. Kagan and Thompson attempt to define exactly what phenomenon it is that we are interested in studying. Kagan argues for a descriptive approach to studying emotional behavior, one in which psychological labels are put aside until there is a clear understanding of the behavioral pattern. Thompson provides a thorough review of the possible topics to be studied under the rubric of emotion regulation and emphasizes the importance of context for studying these phenomena. Both authors provide guidelines for approaching the study of emotional behaviors during development. Calkins outlines the influence that individual differences in emotion expression have on emotion regulation. She addresses the role of temperament and temperament/environment interactions and their effect on the development of emotion regulation. Cole, Michel, and Teti deal with the role that emotion regulation plays in developmental psychopathology, outlining the manner in which the development of emotion regulation may become dysfunctional and lead to problem outcomes. Their essay serves as a bridge between traditional developmental work on emotion and research in developmental psychopathology. The four essays in Part 2 focus on three different physiological systems-the neuroendocrine (Stansbury and Gunnar), autonomic nervous (Porges, Doussard-Roosevelt, and Maiti), and central nervous (Dawson and Fox) systems. These essays share common approaches to the study of emotion regulation, even though each system presents novel and potentially nonoverlapping information about the behaviors in question. The reader is provided with the background necessary to understand each complex physiological system and hence to evaluate the research that is being undertaken in that area. The three essays in Part 3 consider the role of relationships as regulators of emotional behavior. Both Hofer and Field write from the perspective of developmental psychobiology, presenting evidence of the effect that relationships have on physiological systems that are important for growth and development. Cassidy discusses current attachment theory and the role that working models of attachment play in the regulation of emotion. Taken together, these 11 essays offer a particular perspective toward emotional development and emotion regulation. This perspective reflects a functionalist view of emotions and provides evidence for the role that emotions play as regulators even as they themselves are being regulated during behavioral interaction.}

  abstract = {The Behavioral Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (BERQ) is a self-report measure of the behavioral strategies individuals use to regulate emotions in response to stressful or negative events. The purpose of the present study was to report on the psychometric properties of the Turkish version. The sample was recruited through courses at a semi-private university in Turkey and through social-media announcements. A sample of 320 adults (81.9\% females, 18.1\% males) with a mean age of 22.03 (SD = 2.73) completed the Turkish translation of the BERQ, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and the Brief Symptom Inventory. Exploratory factor analysis indicated that the Turkish version replicated the 5-factor structure of the original version; yet, a confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the original model showed an inadequate fit to the present data. Internal consistency coefficients of the subscales ranged between 0.72 and 0.88, and the test-retest reliability of subscales over a 3-week interval ranged from 0.51 to 0.70. As in the original version, we found that actively approaching and seeking social support were more adaptive strategies, whereas withdrawal and ignoring were less adaptive strategies. Results were mixed for the seeking distraction subscale. Additionally, withdrawal significantly predicted future depressive and anxiety symptoms. Overall, our results provide support for the Turkish version of the BERQ as a reliable and valid measure of behavioral emotion regulation strategies.},

  abstract = {Background The present study explored the interrelations between cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS) and depressive symptoms to better understand how young adults with childhood maltreatment (CM) are more prone to depression after recent stressful events. Methods The sample consisted of 342 young adults (M = 19.51 years, range = 17--28 years, 64\% female) who had experienced stressful events in the last six months. Network analysis was used to examine the interrelations between nine CERS and four depressive symptom clusters in exposed (`CM'; n = 182) and not exposed to CM groups (`non-CM'; n = 160). Results We found that somatic symptoms, rumination, putting into perspective, and catastrophizing had high expected influence (EI) in the whole sample network. Global and local connectivity differed between the CM and non-CM groups. More specifically, the structure of the CM network had higher overall connectivity than the structure of the non-CM network. Considering local connectivity, depressed affect, rumination, positive refocusing, and putting into perspective had marginally significantly higher levels of EI in the CM network. We found some significant differences in partial correlations among CERS, such as stronger positive correlations between positive refocusing-catastrophizing, rumination-refocus on planning, and putting into perspective-blaming others in the CM group. Limitations This study was cross-sectional and limited by the use of retrospective self-report tools. Conclusions The findings shed light on the complex interrelations between CERS and depressive symptoms in the context of recent stressful events. Additionally, they highlight potential directions for population-based interventions.},
